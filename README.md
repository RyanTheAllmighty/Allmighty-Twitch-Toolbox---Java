Allmighty Twitch Toolbox
====================================

### What is it?

This is a collection of tools and utilities I use for Twitch to tell me such as notifications for new followers and donations as well as providing a simple UI for the broadcaster to use.

### Coding Standards

+ Please keep all line lengths to 120 characters and use 4 spaces rather than tab characters
+ Please keep all variables at the top of the class
+ Please keep all inner classes at the bottom
+ Please don't use star imports
+ Please use the IntelliJ-Coding-Style.xml for the project (if using IntelliJ) in order to keep all formatting consistent
+ Please don't do large commits. My preference is a single commit for a single fix/addition rather than bundled up commits

### Getting Started

To get a runnable Jar file run 'mvn clean install' in the root of the project.

To get a Twitch API token for use in the application you can either visit http://www.ryandowling.me/twitch-api-token-generator to generate a token using my site or you can follow the directions on Twitch's API docs (https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/authentication.md) making sure to grant rights for all scopes when doing so

For details on setup and information about the inbuilt server used and what you can do with it (such as display notifications on your stream), click the Open Server button on the Settings page to be taken to the index page for the inbuilt server.
