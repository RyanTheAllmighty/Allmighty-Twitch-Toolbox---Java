Twitch Notifier
====================================

### What is it?

This is a notifier I use for Twitch to tell me about new followers and donations as well as providing a simple UI for the broadcaster to use.

### Coding Standards

+ Please keep all line lengths to 120 characters and use 4 spaces rather than tab characters
+ Please keep all variables at the top of the class
+ Please keep all inner classes at the bottom
+ Please don't use star imports
+ Please use the IntelliJ-Coding-Style.xml for the project (if using IntelliJ) in order to keep all formatting consistent
+ Please don't do large commits. My preference is a single commit for a single fix/addition rather than bundled up commits

### Getting Started

To get a runnable Jar file run 'mvn clean install' in the root of the project.
